This program can build a Huffman tree based on the input command. The main.c file is the main function of the program, while the tree.c and helper.c contain the helper functions, which can be used to help to build the Huffman tree. The tree.h and helper.h are the header files of the two .c files.
In the pa10.c file, the main funcition will first check if the input file name has been given or not. If it hasn't been given, the program will print error message to remind the user. Then, the readInput function will build the huffman tree based on the input command. If the inputfile cannot be opened correctly, a NULL pointer will be returned so that in the main function, an error message will be printed on the monitor to indicate users the error. After the readInput function, the provided print function will print the Huffman tree in the desired order.Then, the destroyTree function will deallocate the memory used for the Huffman tree.
In the tree.c function, it contains the print function, which will print the Huffman tree in the desired order.
In the helper.c function, it mainly provides the readInput function.However, to read the input and store the Huffman tree in the desired method.We need to create a stack-like linkedlist,where we can use it to pop and push huffman nodes from the top of the stack. The details about the pop and push untlize function have been provided in the comment section of the tree.c file.
At last, the program will deallocate every piece of memory used to implement this function.
